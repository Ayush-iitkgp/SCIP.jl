## Related Projects

- [SCIP](http://scip.zib.de): actual solver (implemented in C) that is wrapped
  for Julia.
- [CSIP](https://github.com/leethargo/CSIP): restricted and simplified C
  interface to SCIP which our wrapper is based on.
- [SCIP.jl](https://github.com/ryanjoneil/SCIP.jl): previous attempt to
  interface SCIP from Julia, using autogenerated wrapper code for all public
  functions.
- [MathProgBase](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl): We aim to
  implement MPB's abstract solver interfaces, so that one can use SCIP.jl
  through [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl). For now, the
  `LinearQuadraticModel` interface is implemented, supporting lazy constraint
  and heuristic callbacks.
